#                             Contactify
                    
- Contacityf Aims to be a simple contact list management app built with Java/Spring Boot and React.js. This project is a work in progress, created to practice Spring Boot development and learn React.js. 
# The backend is 100% functional and completed, providing full CRUD operations for managing contacts. 
(The application has been tested using Postman to ensure all functionalities work as expected. )
# I will be working on a simple frontend to display the Contactify application, utilizing React.js.
